# ML-Intro
Introduction to Machine Learning: Test, Courses &amp; Examples
In these series of tutorials I implemented some basic codes and trained models on
available dataset (url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/iris.csv") 

Using mainly sklearn and panda libraries

Hopefully these series of tutorials prove useful in my next step to deploy more specialized framework for PEM :)

Will upload expriements on frameworks i.e. Tenserflow or PyTorch on a separate directory; currently learning!
